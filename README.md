# Visual_Recognition_and_Object_Detection

The purpose of this project is to implement relatively simple deep learning models and techniques for transfer learning of object detection models for deep learning computer vision and transfer learning techniques for object detection models for computer vision applications. 

The project is divided into 2 parts: 

1. Image classification on the CIFAR-10 handwritten digits recognition dataset 
2. UAV Object Detection using transfer learning


## Important before compiling the code: Change the path of the images and labels in main
